            <h2>THE AMAZON</h2>
            <p>The Median XL amazon class is the fastest class in the game. Her ranged, melee and magical skills are
                powerful and focus on striking from a distance and moving at high speed.</p>
            <img src="../img/art/intro_amazon.jpg">
            <h2>BACKGROUND OF THE MEDIAN XL AMAZON</h2>
            <p>The inhabitants of the Amazon Islands are mostly known to the outside world as traders, warriors and
                seafarers. Few realise that amazon society is much more complex than is often assumed.</p>
            <p>The faith of the amazon people was considered to be a triune religion centred around the ancient deities
                Hefaetrus, Karcheus and Zerae, each representing one of the elements of nature. In addition to the three
                major deities, there are also a pantheon of guardian gods and goddesses keeping watch over the cities,
                villages and even ships, the most famous of which being Athulua who protects the capital of the same
                name.</p>
            <p>But as scholarly research into amazon history continued, more and more signs and relics of a dark past
                surfaced. There was once a thriving cult devoted to a fourth deity, Kharos, who represented death and
                warfare. The cult engaged in blood sacrifice and reigned for hundreds of years before it was banished
                into the rainforests by the ancient nephalem Philios, Skovos and Lycander, the first high priestesses of
                Hefaetrus, Karcheus and Zerae. After failing to teach the native people the worship of the three
                deities, the priestesses created the three islands bearing their name where they raised a race of
                warriors from ice, fire and thunder and founded the modern amazon culture.</p>
            <p>After reconstructing this fragment of ancient amazon lore, scholarly attention turned to the fourth
                island, Skartara, which was formerly assumed to be uninhabited. But Skartara proved too much for even
                the toughest adventurers. Most research parties never even reached the island, swallowed by the
                treacherous maelstrom or smashed into the jagged cliffs of the island. The few survivors told terrible
                tales of giant flying reptiles, man-eating plants, head-hunting natives, the shapeshifting avatars of a
                savannah deity, wild blood orgies at full moon and worst of all, a living cult dedicated to bringing
                Kharos back to Sanctuary...</p>

            <hr>
            <h2>PREFERRED WEAPONS</h2>
            <p>Loremasters continue to be amazed by the cultural diversity on such a small island as Skartara and the
                way the local conditions shape tribal culture and development, even though the impressions and memories
                of the survivors may be tainted by the fact that their captain was lowered into a volcano and their
                priest eaten alive by a blood tribe.</p>
            <p>The mountain regions are home to nomadic dragon archer tribes and the remnants of the ancient triple
                deity cults. The rocky cliffs and loose ground at the peaks of Skartara can be a much more dangerous foe
                than any opposing tribe. Mobility and distance are of the utmost importance, and many archers prefer to
                fight in light armour. It is said that the few surviving members of the triple deity cults have
                developed techniques to shoot through barriers and summon their many dead to fight for them.</p>
            <p>Ritualistic tribal warfare of the lower savannah regions emphasises a combat technique known as the
                phalanx, where two opposing battlelines march up to each other until contact is made, then attempt to
                push, shove and ram a path through the other side. Warriors trained for this type of combat usually
                wield spears and wear heavy armour to augment their primarily defensive combat doctrine.</p>
            <p>The swampy delta of the Skaryass river is home to several sites of moon worship located around ‘moon
                springs’, gas geysers that burn with an eerie white flame. The mud and water effectively makes melee
                combat impossible and battles are usually fought at a distance with assegais and throwing spears.</p>
            <p>Priestesses of Kharos are often seen wielding enchanted sceptres to symbolise their status and authority
                in the blood cult. Only one sceptre has been retrieved by a particularly daring treasure hunter; unlike
                the finely crafted weapons of the other tribes, the sceptre was found to be of unremarkable construction
                and easy to recreate by any skilled spellsmith.</p>
            <p id="indented"><span class="bold">Class-specific 1h weapon: Amazon Javelin<br>
                    Class-specific 2h weapon: Amazon Bow<br>
                    Class-specific 2h weapon: Amazon Spear (On hit: chance to lower physical resist)<br>
                    Also uses scepters</span></p>
            <hr>
            <h2>PREFERRED ARMOUR</h2>
            <p>The primitive inhabitants of Skartara are not particularly advanced in armourcrafting, except for the
                moonfuries of Skaryass. Due to the swampy marshes around the river delta, dodging thrown weapons is
                impossible and in response the moonfuries developed some of the toughest and heaviest mortal shields
                ever forged, including the legendary setzschild.</p>
            <p>Some surviving explorers also brought specimens of the tribes’ exotic headgear, from heavy steel
                cervellieres to the wicked einherjar helms worn by the wild devotees of Kharos when they consume the
                blood nectar and ride through the night sky on flaming horses to hunt for sacrifices. At least, that was
                what one particularly crazy and half-burnt survivor seemed to remember just after he downed several
                bottles of alcohol and before he screamed Kharos’ name a hundred times and jumped overboard.</p>
            <p>Most scholars agree, though, that this is probably a daytime event.</p>

            <hr>
            <h2>DEVOTIONS</h2>
            <p>Although there do exist roving mercenary bands that assimilate a variety of combat styles into their
                doctrine, most amazon warriors are faithful to their tribe.</p>
            <p>You can only learn the level 18 skill of the bow, spear, javelin or blood trees if you have no points in
                any of the other three skill trees, and vice versa.</p>
