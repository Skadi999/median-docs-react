            <h2>THE SORCERESS</h2>
            <p>The Median XL sorceress class employs devastating spells and powerful wards to protect her should she
                choose to fight in melee combat.</p>
            <img src="../img/art/intro_sorceress.jpg">
            <h2>BACKGROUND OF THE MEDIAN XL SORCERESS</h2>
            <p>The Zann Esu covens have always been regarded with suspicion by the other mage clans of Sanctuary.
                Although their mastery of elemental magic was undeniable, the witch covens keep away from society and
                adhere to strict ethical rules and their own religion of nature worship.</p>

            <p>Their secluded lifestyle and mysterious powers gave rise to rumours among the common folk about hexcraft
                and a pact with the devil. Members of the covens were hunted down as witches and prosecuted by the
                Church until the witches finally fled deep into the forests to the underground city of Zann Rok, never
                to be seen again.</p>

            <p>Now more myth than history, folk tales of the Zann Esu tell of haunting chants and dances to the full
                moon deep in the forest and unearthly spirits hunting down and slaying any witnesses to the spectacle...
            </p>
            <hr>
            <h2>BASE STATS</h2>
            <p>Chance to block: <span class="unique">4%</span></p>

            <hr>
            <h2>PREFERRED WEAPONS</h2>
            <p>Sorceresses are adept at the use of magical staves and orbs as channelling foci for their spells. The
                smaller orbs are one-handed, enabling the spellcaster to carry a shield. However, staves are more
                efficient and allow the sorceress to cast her spells much faster.</p>

            <p>Battlemage warriors are often seen wielding crystal swords or the Zann Esu’s mystical warp blades. A
                combination of channelling athame and war sword, warp blades create energy ripples that enable the
                wielder to strike multiple enemies in a single swing!

            <hr>
            <h2>PREFERRED ARMOUR</h2>
            <p>Because traditional warrior plate is cumbersome and impedes mobility and spell casting, the ancient mage
                clans created their own exotic designs that allow for easy movement and precise gestures. Though the
                knowledge to create this armour has been lost to the ages, you may come across one of the few surviving
                Eastern kazarghands, Khanduran lamellar plates or the splendid Kehjistani ceremonial armours...</p>

            <p id="indented"><span class="bold">Class-specific body armor: Sorceress Armor</span></p>
            <hr>
            <h2>ELEMENTAL SPECIALIZATION</h2>
            <p>If a sorceress wishes to become a master of her arts, she must devote her studies and training to no more
                than two elemental powers.</p>
            <p>The Zann Esu believe that magi who dabble in many arts at once lack the patience and discipline required
                to properly serve the elemental aspects of the Deity. Zann Esu neolytes are consecrated to two elements
                of nature at their rite of passage and are forbidden to study the other elements. Those who violate this
                sacred rule are excommunicated.</p>
            <p><span class="italic">You can only learn two elements out of four (fire, cold, lightning, poison).</span>
            </p>
