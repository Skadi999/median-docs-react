            <h2>WHAT IS MEDIAN XL?<br><br></h2>
            <hr>
            <h6>Overview</h6><br>
            <p>Median XL is the most popular mod, or unofficial modification, for Diablo II Lord of Destruction.<br>
                It modifies the game by replacing character skills, improving items and monsters, and adding new
                uberquests.</p>
            <h6>So is this a cheat?</h6><br>
            <p>Mods are not cheats. A cheat makes the game easier. Median XL turns it into an entirely new game...</p>
            <img src="../img/menu/MXL_menu_033.jpg" alt="Menu 1">
            <hr>
            <h6>Features</h6><br>
            <p><span class="bold">• New skill trees with 30 brand new skills per class.</span><br>
                Bored with Blessed Hammer? Median XL offers brand new skill trees.<br>
                Each class has 25 main skills, 3 uberskills and 2 challenge reward skills.
                If you ever wanted a crossbow necromancer or summoner barbarian, here is your chance!
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• Improved monsters.</span><br>
                When was the last time a frog killed you? The monsters are much more aggressive and dangerous,
                and many have learned various new tricks. From quill rats with homing spikes to invisible templars,
                the monsters will pose a much tougher challenge.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• 29 new uberquests for high level characters.</span><br>
                Forget Battle.net and 'Uber Tristram', Median XL has 21 more uberbosses and 8 special uberlevels for
                high level characters. Defeating them on the highest difficulty yields powerful unique charms.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• New base items. Six quality tiers.</span><br>
                Median XL features many new class-specific items. Additionally, item stats have been rebalanced and
                there are now six tiers of item quality, each with better stats than the last. Rumours persist of even
                stronger Sacred items...
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• New and improved gems and runes.</span><br>
                More gems, more runes and the existing gems and runes have been improved. Plentiful random sockets on
                items offer a powerful way to customise your items.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• Enhanced magic and rare items.</span><br>
                Between the improved affix pool and the addition of powerful new affixes including percentage based
                attribute bonuses, rares are a much improved game option.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• An assortment of new uniques and sets.</span><br>
                Median XL features 680 new uniques and 30 new sets. Many of the uniques and all of the sets can only
                drop in special difficult areas.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• An assortment of new runewords.</span><br>
                There are exactly 333 brand new runewords, the vast majority of which only a single rune. You can fill
                the other
                sockets (before you insert the rune) with jewels for your convenience.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• New and improved cube recipes.</span><br>
                Median XL offers many powerful new cube recipes including a revolutionary crafting system.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">• Honorific items.</span><br>
                Create blank items and enchant them yourself. Ever wanted to make your very own uniques? Now you can.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• Special challenges for expert players.</span><br>
                Beating the game is only half the fun! Reach certain milestones in the game to obtain a special reward.
            </p>

            <p><span class="bold">• Rebalanced drop rates to make good items more common.</span><br>
                You may actually see a Zod now.</p>

            <p><span class="bold">• And much more...</span><br><br></p>

            <h6>New features in Median XL Zeta</h6><br>
            <p>Median XL Zeta, based on Omega 003, mainly focuses on improving quality of life.
                The mod features changes which should make player experience a lot more convenient, while keeping the
                balance of the game intact.
                Among such changes are Oils of Renewal with 50 charges, mass Disenchanting and "Sigging" of Unique&Set
                items, Shrine Vessels and Arcane Clusters to store Shrines and Arcane Crystals respectively, and also a
                much bigger inventory and Horadric Cube.<br>
                Other changes include a fix for the Scroll of Resistances (you now cube it with a certain charm to
                receive the resistance bonus),
                mercenaries being able to wear all equipment excluding a second ring and a new improved
                documentation.<br>
                A lot of unique items with silly names have been renamed, and many items (mostly uniques and charms)
                have gotten new sprites.<br>

            <p>The full list of changes can be found in the changelog on this website.</p>

            <p>Median XL Zeta also comes with devurandom's
                <a href="https://d2mods.info/forum/viewtopic.php?t=65492">Basemod</a>, which features amazing quality
                of life changes
                such as
                ctrl-clicking items to move them to the stash or the Horadric Cube or automatically setting nopickup or
                /players X every time
                you enter the game.</p>

            <p>For players who wish to further modify the game, the txt files for Zeta are available inside the mpq and
                some of them (namely uniqueitems, misc and cubemain) have been cleaned.
                They are now much more readable and do not contain disabled entries.
            </p>

            <p>Most of the ideas for the quality of life features and some of the sprites in the game were taken from
                later versions of Median (Ultimative and Sigma).
            </p>

            <p>Please note that Median XL Zeta is <span class="bold">NOT</span> compatible with save files from any
                other Median XL version.
                Even if you'll be able to log your character, your items will certainly be corrupted.</p>
