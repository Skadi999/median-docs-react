            <h2>CUBE RECIPES</h2>
            <p>Far from being the interesting magical gimmick you may be used to, the Median XL cube is a powerful
                weapon of war.</p>
            <div class="sacredUniqueAreas">
                <span class="bold">Crafting Points</span><br>
                <p>Many cube recipes work only if you have the required amount of Crafting Points on your equipped
                    items. Crafting Point requirements are listed near the recipe in silver text:</p>
                <p class="craftingPoints">Upgrade Egg to Chicken: 200 Crafting Points</p>
                <p>To use this recipe and turn an egg into a chicken, you would need to wear items with a total of +200
                    crafting points or more.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sacredUniqueAreas">

                <p><span class="italic">Oils/Catalysts/Sacrifical Heart/Meditation Candle</span><br>
                    These reagents can be bought from the appropriate vendor.</p>
                <p><span class="italic">Arcane Shards</span><br>
                    This reagent is obtained by disenchanting unique items.</p>
                <p><span class="italic">Arcane Сrystal</span><br>
                    This reagent is created by cubing Arcane Shards in sets of five.</p>
                <p><span class="italic">Mystic Orbs</span><br>
                    These reagents can be bought from any magic items vendor or by killing monsters. Note that not all
                    Mystic Orbs are for sale...</p>
                <p><span class="italic">Shrines</span><br>
                    Crucifixes with an orange name that drop in late Terror and in Destruction difficulty. They enable
                    you to create and bless items, see below.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="disenchanting">DISENCHANTING</h2>
            <h3>Disassemble items into resources</h3>
            <p></p>
            <span class="craftingTitle">Arcane Shards and Crystals</span>
            <p>Destroy spare unique or set items to create Arcane Shards and combine those into Arcane Crystals, which
                are required for other cube recipes.</p>
            <p><span class="bold">Combining Arcane Shards</span><br>
                Arcane Shards of various sizes may be combined in the cube to produce Arcane Crystals and/or Arcane
                Shards of a different size.<br>
                The size of a crystal is indicated in the parentheses at the end of their name. An Arcane Crystal's size
                is 5.<br>
                The combined size of the input shards in the cube must not exceed 15. You may not put Arcane Crystals in
                the cube, either. (That would be pointless!)</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">X unique items (up to 10) + Catalyst of Disenchantment -> X Arcane Shards +
                    Catalyst of Disenchantment<br>
                    X set items (up to 10) + Catalyst of Disenchantment -> X Arcane Shards + Catalyst
                    of Disenchantment</span></p>
            <p><span class="reagent">X Arcane Shards (up to 15) -> Y Combined Crystals & Shards (up to 3
                    crystals)</span>
            </p>
            <p>A few examples of the last recipe for clarification:</p>
            <p class="italic">Arcane Shards (4) + Arcane Shards (1) + Arcane Shards (3) -> 1 Arcane Crystal +
                Arcane Shards (3)<br>
                Arcane Shards (2) + Arcane Shards (2) + Arcane Shards (1) -> 1 Arcane
                Crystal<br>
                Arcane Shards (2) + Arcane Shards (1) + Arcane Shards (1) -> Arcane Shards
                (4)<br>
                Arcane Shards (4) + Arcane Shards (4) + Arcane Shards (4) + Arcane Shards (3) -> 3
                Arcane Crystals<br>
            </p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Arcane Clusters</span>
            <p>Arcane Clusters are a quality of life item which acts as a container for Arcane Crystals. Their purpose
                is to conserve storage space, which would otherwise be taken by multiple crystals.
                Arcane Clusters have a maximum capacity of 500 crystals. Currently, you may cube only 1 crystal with a
                cluster
                at a time.</p>
            <p class="reagent">Arcane Crystal + Oil of Transmutation -> Arcane Cluster with 1 stored crystal</p>
            <p class="reagent">Arcane Cluster + Arcane Crystal -> Arcane Cluster +1 stored crystal<br>
                Arcane Cluster -> Arcane Crystal & Arcane Cluster -1 stored crystal
            </p>
            <p>If an Arcane Cluster with 1 charge is transmuted in the cube, it returns the Arcane Crystal and oil that
                were used in creating the cluster.</p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Signets of Learning</span>
            <p>Destroy spare unique or set items to create Signets of Learning. Click the signet to gain attribute
                points permanently.
            </p>
            <p>X unique/set items (up to 25) + Catalyst of Learning -> Signet of Learning (X stat points) + Catalyst of
                Learning
            </p>
            <span class="italic">Each character can use a maximum of 500 Signets of Learning.</span>

            <h2 id="itemQuality">ITEM QUALITY RECIPES</h2>
            <h3>Change the quality level of your items</h3>
            <p></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Upgrade to Non-magical Item</span>
            <p>Upgrade any low quality item to regular quality or a regular item to superior. This also rerolls the
                socket count on the item.<br>
                You may use this recipe on superior items to reroll their socket count and modifiers, as if you rerolled
                it with an Oil of Renewal.</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Low quality item + Oil of Enhancement -> reroll item as regular<br>
                    Regular item + Oil of Enhancement -> reroll item as superior</span></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Upgrade to Magical/Rare Item</span>
            <p>Use these two recipes to upgrade a non-magical item to magic (blue color) or a magic item to rare (yellow
                color)</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Non-magical item + Oil of Enhancement + rune -> reroll item as magic<br>
                    Magic item + Oil of Enhancement + rune -> reroll item as rare</span></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Reroll Magic to Honorific</span>
            <p>Honorific items are blank items that receive a double bonus from Mystic Orbs. This enables you to create
                your own custom items, provided you have some money to spend on the ingredients and the Mystic Orbs.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="../items/honorific_shrine.html">HONORIFIC AND SHRINE CRAFTS</a> page for more details.
            </p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Magic weapon/armor + Meditation Candle + Sacrifical Heart -> return item as
                    honorific</span></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Reroll any Item to Unique</span>
            <p>This powerful recipe uses the reagents obtained by disenchanting other uniques to turn any tiered item of
                your choosing into a unique. But choose wisely, because the crystals are precious and costly to
                replace.<br>
                You may never get Sacred items (including jewelry and quivers) using this recipe.</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Any non-sacred item + Oil of Enhancement + Arcane Crystal x2 -> reroll item as
                    unique</span></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Chaos Reroll Recipe</span>
            <p>Ready to roll the dice? Your item may turn into a lowly white or magical item... or a powerful rare or
                unique. This recipe cannot create sacred uniques or sets, but it can create almost anything else for
                cheap.</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Any item + Oil of Luck + jewel -> reroll item randomly (item level caps at
                    99)</span></p>
            <span class="craftingTitle">Affix Burn Recipe</span>
            <p>This explosive alchemical combination burns all magic off an item, returning it as a basic low quality
                item. This recipe is useful to prepare an item for a runeword.</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Any item + Catalyst of Destruction + rune -> reroll item as low quality + Catalyst
                    of Destruction</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic"><span class="bold">Warning!</span> Do not forget the rune or you will destroy more
                    than you bargained for.</span></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Reroll Modifiers</span>
            <p>These recipes reroll the modifiers and socket count on any non-magical, magic or rare item. This is
                useful when you have a bad rare that could have been good, or to try and get better superior bonuses on
                your item before making a runeword.<br>
                You may also use a Flask of Renewal instead of the Oil. It functions the same way, but has 50 charges
                and is 50 times more expensive. Use it if you want to reroll an item many times.</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Non-magical item + Oil/Flask of Renewal -> reroll item<br>
                    Magic item + Oil/Flask of Renewal -> reroll item<br>
                    Rare item + Oil/Flask of Renewal -> reroll item</span></p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Zomghelp Recipe</span>
            <p>When Lady Luck turns her back and leaves you without a viable weapon or armour, this recipe allows you to
                create yourself some baseline items. The items come with very weak random stats, but have a built-in
                enhanced damage or defence bonus.</p>
            <p><span class="reagent">Magic weapon/armor + magic amulet + magic ring -> reroll item as level 1 magic
                    item</span></p>
            <p><span class="italic">This recipe also adds <span class="magic">+25% Enhanced Damage</span> (weapons) or
                    <span class="magic">+25% Enhanced Defense</span>
                    (armour) if you use it at character level 1, and an additional +2% for each higher character level.
                    A level 40 character, for example, will get +103%.</span></p>

            <h2 id="uptier">UPTIER RECIPES</h2>
            <h3>Upgrade items to the next higher tier</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>Uptiering an item increases its base statistics and maximum sockets but also increases requirements.
                These recipes cannot create Sacred items.</p>
            <p>See the <a href="../items/base_items.html">BASE ITEMS</a> page for more information about item tiers.</p>
            <span class="craftingTitle">Uptier Recipe</span>

            <h3>Call on divine forces to craft your own items</h3>
            <p></p>
            <p>In Terror and Destruction difficulty, you may find blessed relics from the ancient labyrinth beneath
                Tristram, stolen before its collapse.</p>
            <p>During those dark days the holy shrines in the cathedral's catacombs offered salvation to some
                adventurers and damnation to others; removed from their sockets, the enchanted crosses cannot
                permanently affect humans anymore, but their divine powers can be applied to items.</p>
            <p>There are 15 types of shrines with eldritch names and a short clue as to what the shrine does. Beware,
                results may vary depending on divine will. The Shrine names are as follows:</p>
            <p class="holy">Abandoned Shrine<br>
                Creepy Shrine<br>
                Eerie Shrine<br>
                Fascinating Shrine<br>
                Gloomy Shrine<br>
                Hidden Shrine<br>
                Magical Shrine<br>
                Ornate Shrine<br>
                Quiet Shrine<br>
                Sacred Shrine<br>
                Shimmering Shrine<br>
                Spiritual Shrine<br>
                Stone Shrine<br>
                Tainted Shrine<br>
                Weird Shrine</p>

            <p>Each shrine comes with 10 charges. Each use in the cube will drain one charge. When you use up the last
                charge, the shrine disappears.</p>
            <p>Experiment, learn and create some of the most powerful items in all of Sanctuary.</p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Shrine Crafting</span>
            <p>Use a shrine to turn any sacred item into a powerful crafted item. The crafted item comes with several
                random rare modifiers and there is a high chance that some preset modifiers based on shrine type will
                appear as well. The preset modifiers may stack with the rare modifiers, creating some very powerful
                items.</p>
            <p class="reagent">Rare/unique/set/crafted Sacred item + Shrine -> reroll item as crafted + Shrine -1 charge
            </p>
            <p><i>Crafted items always have maximum sockets and receive a double bonus from Mystic Orbs.</i></p>
            <div class="sacredUniqueAreas">
                <span class="bold">What affixes will the item get?</span><br>
                <p>The resulting crafted item spawns with <u>0-3 preset affixes</u> depending on luck and shrine type
                    used, and
                    <u>1-4 extra random rare affixes</u>, based on the item level:</p>
                <p class="note">Item level 1-30 : 40% chance of 1 affix and 20% chance each of 2, 3 or 4 affixes.<br>
                    Item level 31-50 : 60% chance of 2 affixes and 20% chance each of 3 or 4 affixes.<br>
                    Item level 51-70 : 80% chance of 3 affixes and 20% chance of 4 affixes.<br>
                    Item level 71+ : 100% chance of 4 affixes.<br></p>
                <p>The required level of a crafted item is:</p>
                <p class="note">[level of the highest affix * 3/4] + 10 + 3 * [number of random rare affixes]</p>
                <p>Especially at lower levels, this formula may create items with a required level above the level of
                    the character that crafted them. This is a feature of crafting and occurs in classic LoD as well.
                </p>
                <p>Do not confuse <u>required level</u>, which appears on the item, with <u>item level</u>, which is
                    usually equal to the monster level of the monster that dropped the item.</p>
            </div>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Shrine Blessing</span>
            <p>A variant of shrine crafting, this recipe allows you to impart the blessings of the shrine unto an
                existing sacred item. This randomly adds some or all of the shrine modifiers to the item and subtracts 1
                charge. You can only use this recipe once per item, so choose your shrine wisely.</p>
            <p class="reagent">Non-ethereal rare/crafted/honorific Sacred item + Shrine + Arcane Crystal -> add shrine
                bonuses + Shrine -1 charge</p>
            <p>The item retains its original affixes and gains <u>0-3 preset affixes</u> depending on luck and shrine
                type used.</p>

            <span class="craftingTitle">Shrine Vessels</span>
            <p>Shrine Vessels are a quality of life feature, made to reduce space taken by shrines. They act
                as a container for shrines, allowing you to store up to 500 of them in a vessel.<br>
                There are Shrine Vessels for each of the shrine types, and you may only cube a vessel with shrines of
                the same type.<br>
                Only full shrines (10 charges) can be used to create or fill a Shrine Vessel, and you may cube up to 10
                shrines at a time.</p>
            <p class="reagent">Any Shrine + Oil of Transmutation -> Shrine Vessel of the same type with 1 stored shrine

            <p>If a vessel with 1 charge is transmuted in the cube, it returns the shrine that was used to create it and
                the Oil of Transmutation

            <span class="craftingTitle">Item Destruction Recipe</span>
            <p>Is your stash completely filled with useless garbage? Does the mountain of items where all those monsters
                were just a second ago hide that unique from view? This recipe for destruction will remove just about
                any items you feed it from the game and out of your way.

            <p>If you went wild with reanimate items and now you can't see the forest for the reanimated Ents, this
                recipe can help. It adds the 'R.I.P.' modifier to an item, causing your kills to stay dead instead of
                rising up to get in your way. This should help out players with slower computers.

            <span class="craftingTitle">Apply Trophy to Uberquest Charm</span>
            <p>Killing an uberquest boss will often yield his own special unique charm on Destruction difficulty. But
                before you grab the charm and leave the uberquest area for good, consider that many bosses also have an
                additional 2% chance to drop a special trophy which you can cube with the charm for a small extra bonus.

            <p>Want to show the common rabble in your game how rich and powerful you are? This recipe consumes some of
                the rarest trophies in the game and returns a completely useless item. Show it to friends and strangers
