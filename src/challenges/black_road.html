            <h2>THE BLACK ROAD CHALLENGE</h2>
            <p>The Black Road challenge is the hardest challenge in Median XL. It consists of five trials, ranging from
                easy to very difficult.
            </p>
            <div class="sacredUniqueAreas">
                <p><b>Killing a boss</b><br>
                    This challenge requires you to 'kill' a boss. This means that you need to be physically present at
                    the battle and <u>near the boss when it dies</u> before you can use the cube recipe that grants you
                    the
                    reward.
                </p>
                <p>If you succeed in killing the target boss, you get a whirling red overlay that looks like three
                    rotating bolts:
                </p>
                <img src="../img/highlights/doc_swirlies.jpg">
                <p>You now have 30 seconds to perform the cube recipe. If you are too slow and the red overlay vanishes,
                    you have to do it again!
                </p>
                <p><b>Warning:</b> This does not work if the monster is killed by reflected damage, due to a Diablo II
                    engine limitation. Please use different means of killing the target.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="sacredUniqueAreas">
                <p>
                    <b>You need your Class Charm</b><br>
                    This challenge requires you to have your 'Class Charm'. This is a charm that drops in the Kurast
                    3000 BA uberlevel. If you did the Ennead Challenge, you already have one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If not, see <a href="../uberquests/dungeon_uberquests.html">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about
                    Kurast 3000 BA.
                </p>
                <p>There are 7 class charms, one for each character class.</p>
            </div>

            <h2>THE FIVE TRIALS</h2>

            <p>It is said that the demon Kabraxas rewards his followers with infernal powers: the ability to heal, cast
                apocalyptic spells or fight like no mere human ever could.
            </p>

            <p>To obtain Kabraxas' favour, you will need to pass his tests of faith first. These tests are based on the
                human weaknesses Kabraxas exploits to corrupt mortals. Thankfully, you are well above being corrupted...
                right?
            </p>

            <p>The Black Road Challenge consists of five parts. You can do them in any order, but you need to do all of
                them if you want the reward.
            </p>
            <hr>

            <p><b>1. Trial of Fear</b><br>
                Overcome your fear of demons by tackling the Butcher in Terror difficulty. Go to The Hole Level 2
                and summon him, then kill him. Cube the charm while the red swirls are on your character.</p>
            <p>See <a href="../uberquests/summoning_uberquests.html">THIS PAGE</a> for more information on the Butcher.
            </p>
            <p class="reagent">[Class Charm] -> returns [Class Charm] with note of completion (Fear)</p>

            <p><b>2. Trial of Greed</b><br>
                Material wealth is a sign of demonic corruption. To pass this trial, keep 666,666 gold or more on your
                character (not your stash), then use the recipe to complete the trial.</p>
            <p class="reagent">[Class Charm] -> returns [Class Charm] with note of completion (Greed)</p>

            <p><b>3. Trial of Contrition</b><br>
                Kabraxas is almost impressed with your combat prowess against demons. But how about other humans? To
                complete this Trial, summon and kill Shaman King Koth on Terror difficulty. Cube the charm while the red
                swirls are on your character.</p>
            <p>See <a href="../uberquests/summoning_uberquests.html">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about King Koth.
            </p>
            <p class="reagent">[Class Charm] -> returns [Class Charm] with note of completion (Contrition)</p>

            <p><b>4. Trial of Knowledge</b><br>
                Obtain untold wisdom by collecting the positronic brains of the five Robot Bosses in Fauztinville in
                Terror difficulty. Kill the Robot Bosses and snap up their Brains.</p>
            <p>See <a href="../uberquests/uberlevels.html">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about Fauztinville.
            </p>
            <p class="reagent">[Class Charm] + Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta, Epsilon Brain -> returns [Class Charm] with
                note of completion (Knowledge)</p>

            <p class="italic">Fauztinville is a huge level, and the Robot Bosses are fairly well hidden. You may need to
                explore the whole level. One of the bosses requires a teleportation ability to access; if you cannot
                teleport, use an item with charges of a teleportation skill, like the runeword Pax Mystica or the
                ubercharm Moon of the Spider. A second boss is at the end of a hidden passage, but can be accessed
                through teleportation as well.</p>

            <p><b>5. Trial of Blood</b><br>
                Kabraxas' element is Fire. Try and sway the Amazon Islands to your cause by eliminating the Priestesses
                of the amazon gods of Ice and Lightning. But do it quickly. Kabraxas has no time to waste on bumbling
                humans like you.</p>

            <p>Your targets are Skovos, Priestess of Karcheus and Lycander, Priestess of Zerae. Both can be found in the
                Tran Athulua uberlevel. Go kill them on Terror difficulty.
            </p>

            <p>The catch is that after you kill either one, you now have only 30 seconds to kill the other and then cube
                the charm. The timer starts to tick down after your first kill. You can only complete this Trial if you
                lead them to the same area and kill them quickly, one after the other.
            </p>

            <p>See <a href="../uberquests/uberlevels.html">THIS PAGE</a> for more information about Tran Athulua.</p>

            <p class="italic">There is a third Priestess on the level, Philios, Priestess of Hefaetrus. Make sure you
                kill the correct Priestesses.</p>
            <p class="italic">The amazon bosses have relatively low health, and you don't want to kill them too early or
                you would have to restart the trial. A few helpful tips to keeping the amazons alive:<br>
                Try not using damaging buffs such as Queen of Blades or Symhpony of Destruction, disable reanimates via
                the RIP recipe (if you want the reanimates later, equip a temporary item that you won't be using anymore
                and put the RIP recipe on it), and if possible use abilities of the element that the amazon boss is
                immune to. A Sorceress, for example, could spread the area around Skovos with Abyss.
            </p>

            <p class="reagent">[Class Charm] -> returns [Class Charm] with note of completion (Blood)</p>

            <p><b>Black Road Completion</b><br>
                You did all five Challenges above? Great! Buy four Sacrifical Hearts (sold by magic item vendors) and
                cube them with your class charm. If you completed all five Challenges, this will add a number of bonuses
                and unlock the Level Challenge Skill in your skill tree.
